# WildFly Commonhaus Organization Governance

This document outlines the governance model for WildFly-associated open source software projects sponsored by the [Commonhaus Foundation](https://www.commonhaus.org) under the terms of the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement between WildFly and Commonhaus. The set of projects operating under this sponsorship are referred to herein as the “WildFly Commonhaus Organization”.

This governance model is designed to uphold the principles of transparency, open collaboration, and community involvement.

## Top-Level Projects

The WildFly Commonhaus Organization covers a number of open source projects that provide the WildFly application server, extensions to it, different mechanisms for consuming it, tooling for producing or using it, software components integrated into it as well as ancillary materials related to it. A number of the open source projects providing components are also used outside the WildFly application server and have their own separate identity, branding and mode of operation. These projects, along with the WildFly Application Server project itself, are free to define their own governance policies, so long as those policies conform to the requirements of this document and to the requirements of the Commonhaus Foundation.

The top-level projects are:

- Ironjacamar
- JBeret
- JBoss Parent
- JBoss Threads
- JBoss WS
- Narayana
- RESTEasy
- Undertow
- Weld
- WildFly Application Server

Note that Top-Level Projects may themselves incorporate multiple open source projects with their own repositories.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Contributors**: Anyone who contributes to WildFly Commonhaus Organization projects in any form.
- **Maintainers**: Contributors eligible for write access to a WildFly Commonhaus Organization code repository.
Responsible for driving initiatives and reviewing/merging contributions in their area of expertise.
- **Project Leads**: Maintainers (at most one per Top-Level Project) with higher decision power whenever the project they lead is affected.
Responsible for keeping the project’s technical direction consistent, safe and sustainable. This involves in particular enforcing compliance with the requirements of the Commonhaus Foundation.
- **Commonhaus Representative**: The representative for the WildFly Commonhaus Organization on the Commonhaus Foundation’s Extended Governance Committee.
- **Deputy Commonhaus Representative**: Secondary point of contact between the Commonhaus Foundation and the WildFly Commonhaus Organization. Becomes the Commonhaus Representative if the Commonhaus Representative is unable or unwilling to continue in that role.

## Decision-Making

WildFly Commonhaus Organization projects follow a common decision-making process.

### Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus)

WildFly Commonhaus Organization projects primarily aim for a consensus-based decision-making process, where Maintainers and active Contributors discuss and come to an agreement.

In practice, this involves:

- Discussing matters openly, to facilitate others joining the discussions and expressing concerns.
- Taking into account every Contributor’s opinion, regardless of their role.

Actual implementation of consensus decision-making is up to Maintainers and can vary based on the audience and criticality of the discussion. Inspiration may be found in the [Lazy Consensus model as defined by the Apache Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html), and in [Martha’s Rules](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=sociologyfacpub).

### Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise, Maintainers are responsible for facilitating a resolution.

Project Leads hold the power to make the final decision, be it individually for the project they lead, or collectively for cross-project matters.

As a last resort, in particular in case of disagreement about the decision-making process, the Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) can be asked to mediate the discussion.

## Role granting/revoking

The role of Maintainer or Project Lead is granted or revoked according to the policies of the relevant Top-Level Project.

The role of Commonhaus Representative or Deputy Commonhaus Representative is granted or revoked through the decision-making process, with additional restrictions:

1. The discussion must happen on the WildFly development mailing list, as listed in the Community page on this website.
2. The opinion of the Commonhaus Representative or Deputy Commonhaus Representative whose role is being discussed does not factor into the decision.
3. Discussions regarding the role of Commonhaus Representative or Deputy Commonhaus may not last less than 30 days.

Eligible candidates for the role of Commonhaus Representative or Deputy Commonhaus Representative are:

- Any contributor to a WildFly Commonhaus Organization project, provided the candidate is a Commonhaus Foundation member, and agrees to become a Signatory of the Commonhaus Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement before taking on their new role.

Upon the adoption of the initial version of this governance policy the Commonhaus Representative will be Brian Stansberry and the Deputy Commonhaus Representative will be Thomas Jenkinson.

The Commonhaus Representative and Deputy Commonhaus Representative keep their role indefinitely, unless they resign or a new decision revokes their role.

The list of people in the Maintainer, Project Lead, Commonhaus Representative and Deputy Commonhaus Representative roles is kept up-to-date on the "Team.md" page of this repository.
