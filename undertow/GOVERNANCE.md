# Undertow Governance

This document outlines the governance model for Undertow IO open source software projects sponsored by the [Commonhaus Foundation](https://www.commonhaus.org) under the terms of the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement between WildFly and Commonhaus. The set of projects operating under this sponsorship are referred to herein as the “Undertow IO”.

This governance model is designed to uphold the principles of transparency, open collaboration, and community involvement.

## Undertow IO Projects

The projects are:

- Undertow
- Undertow EE
- Jastow

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Contributors**: Anyone who contributes to Undertow IO Projects in any form.
- **Maintainers**: Contributors eligible for write access to an Undertow IO code repository.
Responsible for driving initiatives and reviewing/merging contributions in their area of expertise.
- **Project Leads**: Maintainers (at most one per Top-Level Project) with higher decision power whenever the project they lead is affected.
Responsible for keeping the project’s technical direction consistent, safe and sustainable. This involves in particular enforcing compliance with the requirements of the Commonhaus Foundation.

## Decision-Making

Undertow IO projects follow a common decision-making process.

### Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus)

Undertow IO projects primarily aim for a consensus-based decision-making process, where Maintainers and active Contributors discuss and come to an agreement.

In practice, this involves:

- Discussing matters openly, to facilitate others joining the discussions and expressing concerns.
- Taking into account every Contributor’s opinion, regardless of their role.

Actual implementation of consensus decision-making is up to Maintainers and can vary based on the audience and criticality of the discussion. Inspiration may be found in the [Lazy Consensus model as defined by the Apache Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html), and in [Martha’s Rules](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=sociologyfacpub).

### Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise, Maintainers are responsible for facilitating a resolution.

Project Leads hold the power to make the final decision, be it individually for the project they lead, or collectively for cross-project matters.

As a last resort, in particular in case of disagreement about the decision-making process, the Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) can be asked to mediate the discussion.

## Role granting/revoking

The role of Maintainer or Project Lead is granted or revoked according to the policies of the relevant Top-Level Project.

The role of Commonhaus Representative or Deputy Commonhaus Representative is granted or revoked through the decision-making process, with additional restrictions:

1. The discussion must happen on the [Undertow Dev List ](https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/undertow-dev)
2. The opinion of the Maintainer or Project Lead whose role is being discussed does not factor into the decision.
3. Discussions regarding the role of Commonhaus Representative or Deputy Commonhaus may not last less than 30 days.

Eligible candidates for the role of Maintainers and Project Leads are any contributor to a Undertow IO project, provided the candidate is a Commonhaus Foundation member, and agrees to become a Signatory of the Commonhaus Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement before taking on their new role.

The list of people in the Maintainer and Project Lead roles is kept up-to-date on the "Team.md" page of this repository.
