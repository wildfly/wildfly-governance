# JBoss Web Services (JBoss WS) Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the JBoss Web Services (JBoss WS) projects. 
This governance model is designed to uphold the principles of transparency, open collaboration, and community involvement.


## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Contributors**: Anyone who contributes to the JBoss Web Services project in any form.

- **Maintainers**: Contributors eligible for write access to a code repository for the JBoss Web Services projects. 
 Responsible for driving initiatives and reviewing/merging contributions in their area of expertise. 

- **Publishers**: Maintainers with the right to publish releases of the projects they maintain. 

- **Project Leaders**: Maintainers with higher decision power. 
 Responsible for keeping JBoss Web Services projects’s technical direction consistent, safe and sustainable. 
 This involves in particular enforcing compliance with requirements of the Commonhaus Foundation.


## Decision-Making

JBoss Web Services projects follow a common decision-making process.

### Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus)

JBoss Web Services projects primarily aim for a consensus-based decision-making process, where Maintainers and Contributors discuss and come to an agreement.

In practice, this involves:

- Discussing matters openly, to facilitate others joining the discussions and expressing concerns.
- Taking into account every Contributor’s opinion, regardless of their role.

Actual implementation of consensus decision-making is up to Maintainers and can vary based on the audience and criticality of the discussion. 
Inspiration may be found in the [Lazy Consensus model as defined by the Apache Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html), and in 
[Martha’s Rules](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=sociologyfacpub).


## Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise, Maintainers are responsible for facilitating a resolution.
The Project Lead holds the power to make the final decision.
As a last resort, in particular in case of disagreement about the decision-making process, the Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) can be asked to mediate the discussion.


## Role granting

The role of Maintainer, Publisher or Project Leader is granted or revoked through the decision-making process, with additional restrictions:

1. The discussion must happen on the [JBoss Web Services development mailing list](https://lists.jboss.org/archives/list/jbossws-dev@lists.jboss.org).
2. The opinion of the Maintainer, Component Lead or Project Leader whose role is being discussed does not factor into the decision.
3. Discussions regarding the role of Project Lead may not last less than 30 days, for the Maintainer role they should last at least 7 days.

The list of people in the Maintainer, Publisher or Project Leader roles is kept up-to-date on the "Team.md" page of this repository.

Eligible candidates for the various roles are:

**For the role of Maintainer**

Any contributor.

**For the role of Publisher**

Any Maintainer of the project being released. However, eligibility for the Publisher role may be influenced by the policies of the organizations to which released artifacts are published.

**For the role of Project Leader**

Any contributor to the project they will lead.


## Role revoking

Maintainers, Publishers, and Project Leader keep their role indefinitely, unless they resign or a new decision revokes their role.

The Project Leader may at any time propose the removal from the Maintainer role of persons who have been inactive for longer than two years. 
Such a proposal would be considered using the normal decision-making process.

When necessary to protect the interests of the project, the Project Leaders may, without discussion, remove privileges associated with the Maintainer and Publisher roles (e.g. code repository write permissions). Such an action should be followed by a discussion of how to correct the issue that led to the removal, or by a discussion of revoking the role.

## Code of Conduct
