# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Narayana project. Narayana is sponsored by the [Commonhaus Foundation](https://www.commonhaus.org) under the terms of the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement between WildFly and Commonhaus. Narayana is one of the projects operating under that sponsorship within the “WildFly Commonhaus Organization”.

The Narayana governance model is designed to uphold the principles of transparency, open collaboration, and community involvement.

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Contributors**: Anyone who contributes to Narayana project in any form.

**Maintainers**: Contributors eligible for write access to a Narayana projects code repositories.
Responsible for driving initiatives and reviewing/merging contributions in their area of expertise.

**Project Lead**: Maintainer (at most one per code repository) with higher decision power.
Responsible for keeping Narayana projects' technical direction consistent, safe and sustainable. This involves in particular enforcing compliance with requirements of the Commonhaus Foundation.

## Decision-Making

### Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus)

The Narayana project primarily aims for a consensus-based decision-making process, where Maintainers and active Contributors discuss and come to an agreement.
In practice, this involves:
Discussing matters openly, to facilitate others joining the discussions and expressing concerns.
Taking into account every Contributor’s opinion, regardless of their role.

Actual implementation of consensus decision-making is up to Maintainers and can vary based on the audience and criticality of the discussion. Inspiration may be found in the [Lazy Consensus model as defined by the Apache Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html), and in [Martha’s Rules](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=sociologyfacpub).

### Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise, Maintainers are responsible for facilitating a resolution.

The Project Lead holds the power to make the final decision.

As a last resort, in particular in case of disagreement about the decision-making process, the Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) can be asked to mediate the discussion.

## Role granting/revoking

The role of Maintainer or Project Lead is granted or revoked through the decision-making process, with additional restrictions:

The discussion must happen in a public space, such as on the [Narayana developer zulip channel]([https://narayana.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/323715-developers)).
The opinion of the Maintainer or Project Lead whose role is being discussed does not factor into the decision.
Discussions regarding the role of Project Lead may not last less than 30 days, for the Maintainer role they should last at least 7 days.

Eligible candidates are:

**For the role of Maintainer**

* Any contributor.

**For the role of Project Leader**

* Any contributor.

**Project Leads** keep their role indefinitely, unless they resign or a new decision revokes their role.

**Maintainers** retain their role for at least 2 years since their last contribution at which point they can have their role changed to contributors as part of (ir)regular cleanup. A maintainer can also resign or a new decision may revoke their role.
